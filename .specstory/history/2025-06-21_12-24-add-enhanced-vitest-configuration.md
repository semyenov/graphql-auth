_**Assistant**_



---

Okay, I'll start by adding an enhanced Vitest configuration. To do that, I'll first examine your existing `vitest.config.ts` file to understand the current setup.

---

Read file: vitest.config.ts

---



---

Okay, I've reviewed your `vitest.config.ts`. It's quite detailed. Before I propose enhancements, I'll check your `package.json` to see which version of Vitest you're using. This will help me ensure my suggestions are compatible with your setup.

---

Read file: package.json

---



---

Based on my review of your Vitest setup and `package.json`, I've crafted an enhanced configuration for you.

Here are the key improvements in the new `vitest.config.ts`:

*   **Switched to `'node'` environment:** This is more appropriate and performant for a backend project than `'happy-dom'`.
*   **Simplified and clarified execution settings:** I've removed redundant options and added comments to explain why sequential execution and process-level isolation (`forks`) are necessary for your database-dependent tests.
*   **Improved developer experience:** I've added `passWithNoTests: true` to prevent errors on test files without any tests, and `logHeapUsage: true` to help monitor for memory leaks.
*   **More robust coverage:** The coverage configuration is now more explicit, including all files in `src` by default, adding more specific exclusion patterns for non-application code, and adding the `lcov` reporter which is useful for CI integrations.
*   **Better organization and comments:** I've reorganized the file and added extensive comments to explain the purpose of each section, especially for the more complex module resolution and Vite-specific options.

I will now apply these enhancements to your `vitest.config.ts` file.

I've updated your `vitest.config.ts` with the enhanced configuration. The new setup is better tailored for your backend project, with improved performance settings, more robust code coverage, and clearer organization. Let me know if you have any other questions
