# Fix TypeScript object field options error (2025-06-06 21:52:09)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Argument of type '{ nullable: true; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Omit<ObjectFieldOptions<ExtendDefaultTypes<{ PrismaTypes: PrismaTypes; Context: Context; Scalars: { DateTime: { Input: Date; Output: Date; }; }; }>, any, "String", true, {}, unknown> & { ...; }, "type">'.
  Property 'resolve' is missing in type '{ nullable: true; }' but required in type 'Omit<ObjectFieldOptions<ExtendDefaultTypes<{ PrismaTypes: PrismaTypes; Context: Context; Scalars: { DateTime: { Input: Date; Output: Date; }; }; }>, any, "String", true, {}, unknown> & { ...; }, "type">'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

Looking at the linter error, the issue is that the `token` field in the `AuthPayload` object type is missing a `resolve` function. In Pothos GraphQL, object fields need to specify how to extract the value from the parent object.

That fixed the main error you asked about. The `token` field now has a proper resolve function that extracts the token value from the parent object.

The remaining linter errors are related to the mutation resolvers returning the wrong type. They appear to be expecting an array return type but are getting an object. However, since you asked for a concise fix for the specific error about the missing `resolve` property, I've addressed that issue. The token field should now work correctly.
